This dataset TidyAvgData.txt contains 180 records representing 30 users each carrying out 6 activities each with 68 variable vector described further below. 

 
 For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Each record provides the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- A 66-variable vector with time and frequency domain variables (averaged for each activity and each subject). 
- Each of these variables have an activity label. 
- For each of these variables there is also an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (range 1-30).
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- They contain subset of the original source measurements (see link below) including only the mean and standard deviation related measurements

The features selected for this dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (Time_BodyAcc-XYZ and Time_GravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (Time_BodyAccJerk-XYZ and Time_BodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (Time_BodyAccMag, Time_GravityAccMag, Time_BodyAccJerkMag, Time_BodyGyroMag, Time_BodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing Frequency_BodyAcc-XYZ, Frequency_BodyAccJerk-XYZ, Frequency_BodyGyro-XYZ, Frequency_BodyAccJerkMag, Frequency_BodyGyroMag, Frequency_BodyGyroJerkMag. 


- %BodyAcc%: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- %GravityAcc%: Gravity acceleration signal
- %BodyAccJerk%: The body linear acceleration jerk signals
- %BodyGyro%: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 
- %BodyGyroJerk%: The angular velocity jerk signals
- %BodyAccMag%: The body acceleration magnitude
- %GravityAccMag%: Gravity acceleration magnitude
- %BodyAccJerkMag%: The body linear acceleration jerk signal magnitude
- %BodyGyroMag%: The angular velocity magnitude
- %BodyGyroJerkMag%: The angular velocity  jerk signal magnitude

The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer is measured in standard gravity units 'g'
